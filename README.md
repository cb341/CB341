# Heyya I am Dani 👋

Somehow here, trying to make the world a better place.  
Also sometimes breaking it. On purpose.

## Who iz me?

- Proud Ruby on Rails dev at Renuo (2y+), I know some rails (I think)
- Computer Science student at Zurich School of Engineering ZHAW, part time
- Board member of da queer group at ZHAW
- I sometimes write words at cb341.dev
- Currently learning Rust, compiler yells at me but we are getting there
- Very interested in low level computers, ASM, transistors, logic and how bits actually think

## Stuff I like

- Programming and telling computers what to do
- Factory simulation games, I liekw using calculators
- Computer graphics, like digging around in pixels, very newbie but curious
- Unix systems and friendly terminals
- Mathematics, sometimes it likes me back

## Things I also like doing

- I like breaking stuff
- "Occasionaly" create and review Memes
- Yap on Discord

## Some _recent-ish_ stuff

| My Hello World Rust Project | A multi threaded Client / Server Voxel Engine with custom perlin noise based terrain generation (mountains, caves, trees etc.), custom geometry generation as well as serealization and compression via serde and some knowledge aquired at the school of engineering. | <img width="2388" height="1256" alt="CleanShot 2026-01-01 at 19 43 15@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8b3ad0c-3c37-4889-aee0-98cf65a56868" /> |
| **Minimal Abstraction 8Bit CPU**| I built a simple 8Bit CPU architecture out of single bit logic gates with little to no abstraction to get a big picture of how a basic computer can do stuff.

| **Basic 64 Byte RAM component** | I like having many tabs open. Was wondering how RAM works internally. I like to learn by doing so I have a naive hardware impl | <img width="1080" height="859" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2125e7d5-8b27-4459-b08f-0fce7f4948fd" /> |
| **[WIP] Hardware RMU (Ray Marching Unit) concept**     | Goal is to design hardware in an emulator that is optimized to perform ray marching on a set of primitives, making use of SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data).                                                                                                                           | <img width="1928" height="1922" alt="CleanShot 2025-09-02 at 23 51 39@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619ee8da-58d5-4ee7-8027-f3d49fa9f99d" />     |
